# discord_bot
A simple discord bot with toss the coin and dnd roll games. Also can delete messages from users in "ban list"
It takes all the info - ban list, channels on the server and users from json file in data folder placed near the .py file (need to create it manually)
It uses id for users' and channels' identification, which can be retrieved by activating developers mode in Discord.
Have fun!
